# Setting Up Your Solo Scorecard

This scorecard will go with you for the rest of this curriculum and will be used
by other instructors and your career coaches as you finish this curriculum and
enter the job search. Make sure you keep track of it. Use the [link] to go the
scorecard.

You will need to:

1. Make a copy of the scorecard so that you have your own
2. Share the scorecard
3. Make the scorecard editable by anyone with the link
4. Pass the scorecard link on to your project advisors
5. Fill out the purple areas with the necessary information on the React tab of
   the sheet

## 1. Make a copy

Under the `File` menu under the title of the Google Sheet in the upper left,
select `Make a Copy`. From there, name the copy what you want it to be. It's
probably simplest to just name it

```plaintext
JSPY Solo Progress Scorecard - [FIRSTNAME LASTNAME]
```

and fill out your first name and last name appropriately. If you want to place
it inside of a specific folder, you can do so by clicking on the button below
`Folder` and navigating that menu. Hit the `OK` button to get directed to your
copy of the scorecard.

## 2. Share the scorecard and 3. Update share settings

In the upper right, click on the `Share` button by your profile image or icon.
Click anywhere in the `Get Link` section to have it expand. Click on the
drop-down that is currently set to `Restricted` and change it to `Anyone with
the link`, then change the drop-down to the right of that which is currently set
to `Viewer` and change that to `Editor`.

## 4. Share the scorecard with your project advisors

Now is a good time to share your scorecard with your project advisors. You can
always come back to this Google Sheet to update things as they change and your
ideas for your project become more concrete.

## 5. Fill out the purple areas

Before project week comes to a close, be sure to come back and fill out the
purple areas on the React Sheet.
